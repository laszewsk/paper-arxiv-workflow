   scope unsuitability.


Details of the solicitation

   * Deadline is 30 September 2024. 
    
   * Journal/Specialty: Frontiers in High Performance Computing -
     section Architecture and Systems

   * Research Topic Title: Infrastructure for Workflow Systems

   * Topic Editor(s): Justin M Wozniak, Andre Merzky, Mihael
     Hategan-Marandiuc

   * The special issue aims to tackle the complexity of workflow
     systems by encouraging a bottom-up design in which necessary and
     well-defined components are used to assemble and construct
     workflow systems.

   * We seek articles that: explore the nature and properties of such
     components through architectural and design constraints or
     through specific use cases that are generalizable introduce new
     and specific workflow components, articulating their necessity
     for workflow systems identify novel ways of integrating existing
     components into workflow systems describe the integration of
     specific components into existing workflow systems introduce
     models, frameworks, and tools which reduce the complexity of
     designing, implementing, and reasoning about workflows and
     workflow systems Priority will be given to works whose
     applicability furthers the understanding of workflows and
     workflow systems.
