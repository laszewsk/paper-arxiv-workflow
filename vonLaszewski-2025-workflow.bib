  abstract =	 {The Data Science domain has expanded monumentally in
                  both research and industry communities during the
                  past decade, predominantly owing to the Big Data
                  revolution. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine
                  Learning (ML) are bringing more complexities to data
                  engineering applications, which are now integrated
                  into data processing pipelines to process terabytes
                  of data. Typically, a significant amount of time is
                  spent on data preprocessing in these pipelines, and
                  hence improving its efficiency directly impacts the
                  overall pipeline performance. The community has
                  recently embraced the concept of Dataframes as the
                  de-facto data structure for data representation and
                  manipulation. However, the most widely used serial
                  Dataframes today (R, pandas) experience performance
                  limitations while working on even moderately large
                  data sets. We believe that there is plenty of room
                  for improvement by taking a look at this problem
                  from a high-performance computing point of view. In
                  a prior publication, we presented a set of parallel
                  processing patterns for distributed dataframe
                  operators and the reference runtime implementation,
                  Cylon [1]. In this paper, we are expanding on the
                  initial concept by introducing a cost model for
                  evaluating the said patterns. Furthermore, we
                  evaluate the performance of Cylon on the ORNL Summit
                  supercomputer.}

                  fluid dynamics (CFD) opens many possibilities for
                  improving simulations of technical and natural
                  systems. However, CFD+ML algorithms require exchange
                  of data, synchronization, and calculation on
                  heterogeneous hardware, making their implementation
                  for large-scale problems exceptionally
                  challenging. We provide an effective and scalable
                  solution to developing CFD+ML algorithms using open
                  source software OpenFOAM and SmartSim. SmartSim
                  provides an Orchestrator that significantly
                  simplifies the programming of CFD+ML algorithms
                  enables scalable data exchange between ML and CFD
                  clients. We show how to leverage SmartSim to
                  effectively couple different segments of OpenFOAM
                  with ML, including pre/post-processing applications,
                  function objects, and mesh motion solvers. We
                  additionally provide an OpenFOAM sub-module with
                  examples that can be used as starting points for
                  real-world applications in CFD+ML.},

                  algorithm has found better solutions than those
                  found by recent GPP algorithms. The success of the

                  representation, a suitable crossover operator and an
                  efficient local hill climbing method which is used
